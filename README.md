A political satire game based on papers, please and doom

# Starmernomics

A browser-based game inspired by "Papers, Please" and "Doom" where you play as the UK Prime Minister. Your decisions impact public policy, British life, and your own survival in office.

## Game Concept

- **Role:** You are the Prime Minister (PM) of the United Kingdom.
- **Gameplay:** Each day, face urgent policy decisions (Papers, Please style), with occasional crisis/action sequences (Doom style).
- **Implications:** Your choices affect the economy, public happiness, security, and your own popularity.
- **Goal:** Stay in office as long as possible while balancing competing interests.

## Mechanics

- **Decision Phase:** Review policy proposals, media headlines, and citizen requests. Approve, deny, or modify them.
- **Crisis Phase:** Occasionally, respond to emergencies (e.g., protests, cyberattacks) with quick reactions.
- **Resource Management:** Track stats like economy, happiness, security, and PM approval.
- **Consequences:** Bad decisions can lead to scandals, protests, or even early resignation.

## Getting Started

1. Open `index.html` in your browser.
2. Play by making decisions and reacting to events.
3. Try to achieve the highest approval and longest term.

## Future Directions

- Add more events, deeper policy options, and richer crisis mechanics.
- Integrate sound, graphics, and save/load features.
- Expand narrative and characters.
